*Designed for Developers* - Favorites works great out-of-the-box for beginners, but a full set of  template functions unlocks just about any sort of custom functionality developers may need. Favorites outputs the minimum amount of markup needed, putting the style and control in your hands.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this worked on cached pages? =
Yes, although the buttons may display the incorrect state momentarily. Button states are updated via an AJAX call after page load in order to accommodate cached pages. This may be noticeable on slower servers.


== Screenshots ==

1. Developer-friendly – easily unenqueue styles and scripts if you are combining and minifying your own. 

2. Enable for anonymous users and save in the session or a browser cookie. Logged-in users' favorites are saved in a custom user meta field.
